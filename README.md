## Welcome to my Login Page 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Estefanie1/LoginPage/edit/gh-pages/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Steps

Using Github I was able to create a free domain to display the login page. Languages used are HTML and CSS for structure and design. 

```markdown
Code block

# HTML CODE

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

###Style

```markdown
Code block

#CSS CODE


```



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Estefanie1/LoginPage/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
